h1. QuickScrollPlus - an extension of QuickScroll2 by KennyTM~, by Nathan Broadbent (www.f-77.com)

h3. NOTE: This is under active development, but the tilt feature is yet to be implemented. See the change log in this README for details of what has been done so far.

This is a fork of QuickScroll2, including bug fixes and 'tilt' scrolling. Will be tested and working iOS 4.1, lower versions are unsupported until they can be tested by someone else.
See here for the original project wiki: http://code.google.com/p/networkpx/wiki/Using_QuickScroll

Please note: This application will only work on a jailbroken iPhone.

h2. Changes / Bug fixes

* Fixed preferences bug where the 'disabled apps' page just crashed.
* Fixed 'disabled apps' controller bug, where the state of the toggles was only saved on suspension, not deallocation.
* Increased minimum size of scrollbar buttons (double the height / width of the circle.)

h2. TODO

* Add disable support for Springboard.
* Add 'tilt' scrolling support. (double tap the scrollbar to activate.)

h2. Application Usage

To use the tilt scrolling feature: 

# Position your iPhone at a comfortable reading angle, and then tilt it a few degrees away from you. This will be the zero calibration point.
# Activate the scrollbars with your prefered method.
# Double tap either the horizontal or vertical scroll bars. They will turn green to indicate that tilt scrolling is now enabled.
# Tilt your iPhone back towards you, and the page will start to scroll. You can control or reverse the speed by adjusting the tilt angle.
# To turn off the tilt scroll feature, double tap the scroll bars again.


h2. Compiling and installing from source

In order to compile and install this application, you must have the following files on your Mac:

* iOS 4.1 SDK or higher (including iPhone 3.2 SDK)
** Sign up for a free apple developer account to download.
* networkpx repository (the original QuickScroll2 source code, and other required files) - check it out in a neighboring directory
** $ svn checkout http://networkpx.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ networkpx-read-only
* iPhone Private Frameworks repository - also check these out in a neighboring directory
** $ git clone git://github.com/kennytm/iphone-private-frameworks.git
** # You must then copy IOSurfaceAPI.h from your system into ./include/IOSurface (we can't distribute this file, as per the Apple license)
** $ cd iphone-private-frameworks && cp /System/Library/Frameworks/IOSurface.framework/Headers/IOSurfaceAPI.h include/IOSurface/
* ldid in /usr/local/bin/
** It was a bit tricky to find, so I've included it in the repository. Run the following from the repo directory:
*** $ sudo cp ldid /usr/local/bin/ && sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/ldid

See here for the original wiki that these requirements are based on: http://code.google.com/p/networkpx/wiki/Compiling_networkpx
