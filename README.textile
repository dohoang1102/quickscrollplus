h1. QuickScrollPlus

h3. - an extension of QuickScroll2 by KennyTM~, developed by Nathan Broadbent (www.f-77.com)

This is a fork of QuickScroll2, including bug fixes and 'tilt' scrolling using the iPhone accelerometer. It has been tested and working on iOS 4.1. However, it is compiled with the 3.2 SDK, so it should work on most >= 3.2 iPhones. If someone is able to confirm this, please let me know.
Note: This application will only ever work on a jailbroken iPhone.
It will also automatically uninstall QuickScroll2 if it is installed, so you will need to reconfigure your settings.

See here for the original QuickScroll2 project wiki: http://code.google.com/p/networkpx/wiki/Using_QuickScroll


h2. Changes / Bug fixes

* Fixed preferences bug where the 'disabled apps' page just crashed.
* Fixed 'disabled apps' controller bug, where the state of the toggles was only saved on suspension, not deallocation.
* Springboard app can now be disabled (was previously not showing because it had no icon and no localized title could be found).
* Increased minimum size of scrollbar buttons (double the height / width of the circle.)
* Added very basic 'tilt' scrolling. (double tap the scrollbar to activate.)
** Currently only supports vertical scrolling in portrait mode, but will be finished soon.

h2. TODO

* Horizontal (x-axis) tilt scrolling in portrait mode.
* Landscape orientation scrolling.
* More configuration options for tilt scrolling.
* More stability, especially when suspending/resuming apps. Recheck for memory leaks and inefficiencies.
* Fix 'disabled apps' settings page:
** Work out how to get icons showing for half of the apps.
** Work out how to use the PS groups without crashing the controller.

 
h2. Installation

Compiling from source is not necessary. The instructions below are just included for anyone interested.
The .deb will hopefully be hosted soon on a public repo.

* Download the .deb package from the 'Downloads' section on this page.
* SSH the package to your iPhone.
* SSH into your iPhone.
* $ dpkg -i hk.ndb.quickscrollplus*********.deb


h2. Application Usage

To use the tilt scrolling feature: 

# Position your iPhone at a 45 degree angle.
# Activate the grey scrollbars with your prefered method (double tap, triple tap, automatic, etc).
# Quickly double tap the vertical scroll bars. They will turn blue to indicate that tilt scrolling is now enabled.
# Tilt your iPhone towards you, and the page will start to scroll. You can control or reverse the speed by adjusting the tilt angle between horizontal and vertical.
# To turn off the tilt scroll feature, tap the scroll bar once.


h2. Compiling and installing from source

In order to compile and install this application, you must have the following files on your Mac:

* iOS 4.1 SDK or higher (including iPhone 3.2 SDK)
** Sign up for a free apple developer account to download.
* networkpx repository (the original QuickScroll2 source code, and other required files) - check it out in a neighboring directory
** $ svn checkout http://networkpx.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ networkpx-read-only
* iPhone Private Frameworks repository - also check these out in a neighboring directory
** $ git clone git://github.com/kennytm/iphone-private-frameworks.git
** # You must then copy IOSurfaceAPI.h from your system into ./include/IOSurface (we can't distribute this file, as per the Apple license)
** $ cd iphone-private-frameworks && cp /System/Library/Frameworks/IOSurface.framework/Headers/IOSurfaceAPI.h include/IOSurface/
* ldid in /usr/local/bin/
** It was a bit tricky to find, so I've included it in the repository. Run the following from the repo directory:
*** $ sudo cp ldid /usr/local/bin/ && sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/ldid

See here for the original wiki that these requirements are based on: http://code.google.com/p/networkpx/wiki/Compiling_networkpx


h3. Modify the paths in ./src/Makefile if necessary.

iPhonePrivateFrameworksPath=../../iphone-private-frameworks
networkpxPath=../../networkpx-read-only 

h3. Compile and package

$ ./makedeb.sh

h3. SSH and install on iPhone

$ scp hk.ndb.quickscrollplus-0.3-1a.deb root@{{iPhone IP}}:/tmp
$ ssh root@{{iPhone IP}}
$ cd /tmp && dpkg -i hk.ndb.quickscrollplus-0.3-1a.deb

Reboot your iPhone, and you're done!

If you are experience crashing or bugs, please install Crash Reporter on your iphone and post the syslog output as an issue.
